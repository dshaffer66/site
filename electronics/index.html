      <h1>Doug Shaffer &dash; Electronics Training and Activities</h1>
      <p>Below is a summary of the electronics projects that I've worked for my training classes and independent experimentation.  This work includes the use and programming of different microcontrollers using the C programming language as well as general circuit design to build the circuits.  Integrated Development Environments (IDE), an oscilloscope, a multimeter, and a digital logic analyzer were also used.</p>

            <summary>Georgia Tech - The Mechatronics Revolution</summary>
            The Mechatronics Revolution training class taught the basics of microcontroller programming and the typical associated hardware components.  
            <br>
            The class utilized the TI MSP432 microcontroller, h-bridge motor drivers, bump sensors, proximity sensor, and UART communication to a laptop.  
            <br>The labs built one on top of another until the sucessful completing of the robotic car shown below.  Examples of the C programming methods were shown in the class but the project labs required us to do the programming and troubleshooting to get the project to work.

            <summary>University of Colorado Embedding Sensors and Motors Specialization &dash; Load Cell Lab</summary>
            The Embedding Sensors and Motors Specialization is a series of classes that taught the concepts of numerous types of sensors and motors.
            <br>
            The was class taught using the Cypress PSOC 5LP microcontroller and associated development environment, IDE.  This lab used a load cell, uA741 amplifiers, LCD screen using parallel communication, and a PicoScope oscilloscope.

            The PID Lab again used the Cypress PSOC 5LP microcontroller and PicoScope oscilloscope.  In the lab, we programmed a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) control loop to control a motor to reach the desired output.

            <summary>555 Timer IC in Astable Mode</summary>
            I experimented independently with the 555 timer IC and built it into a circuit to behave in astable mode.  This allowed it to produce a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal to drive a brushed DC electric motor.  A potentiometer was used to adjust the resistance in the circuit which controls the speed of the motor.

            I experimented independently with the 555 timer IC and built it into a circuit to behave in monostable mode.  This circuit was paired with the previous astable mode circuit.  The monostable mode allowed the motor to run for a specific amount of time after the push of a button.  This time is determined by the capacitors used in the circuit.

            I experimented independently with the 555 timer IC and built it into a circuit to behave in bistable mode.  This circuit was paired with the astable mode circuit from before.  The bistable mode allowed the motor to start at a push of one button and continue to run until a second button is pushed.

            I built a motor driver using the 555 timer in astable mode, as used before, and controlled the start and stop of the motor using the Cypress PSOC 5LP microcontroller.  The program was written to send signals to the circuit through a MOSFET to start and stop the motor at specific time periods.

            <summary>Motor Driver using PWM Signals from a Microcontroller</summary>
            I programmed the Cypress PSOC 5LP microcontroller to drive the motor using Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signals.  The duty cycle of the PWM signal controls how fast the motor should turn.  The program was written to step up the PWM signals after specific time intervals.  The PWM signal is then gradually increased from off to full speed and then gradually decreased to stop the motor.

            An HM-18 Bluetooth Module was added to the circuit with the Cypress PSOC 5LP microcontroller.  The Bluetooth module allowed for serial communication with an Apple iPhone.  A basic joystick app was used to send different signals through Bluetooth to the microcontroller.  The program written for the microcontroller interprets those signals and sets the motor to run at 4 different speeds depending on which button was pushed.

A termial app on the phone was used to send text inputs to the microcontroller via UART serial communication using Bluetooth.  A program was written to control the stepper motor with the following commands:
            <ul>
              <li>'+' takes individual steps forward.</li>
              <li>'-' takes individual steps backwards.</li>
              <li>'S' sets a new home position.</li>
              <li>'H' returns the stepper motor back to its home position.</li>
