			<h1>Doug Shaffer &dash; Electronics Training and Activities</h1>
			<p>Below is a summary of the electronics projects that I've worked for my training classes and independent experimentation.  This work includes the use and programming of different microcontrollers using the C programming language as well as general circuit design to build the circuits.  Integrated Development Environments (IDE), an oscilloscope, a multimeter, and a digital logic analyzer were also used.</p>
